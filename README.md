# UAFT-Helper-GUI
A tiny cross-platform Python UI to drive UnrealAndroidFileTool (UAFT). It helps you discover Android devices, select your game package that exposes Android File Server (AFS), push a UECommandLine.txt with your preferred arguments, list/pull generated .trace/.utrace files from the device and optionally launch UnrealInsights on a selected capture.
